# calculator-react

A simple calculator made with React.

## Running locally

1. First, you need to clone the repository using git...

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/jsmiith/calculator-react
```

2. Next, install all the required dependencies using npm...

```bash
> npm i
```

3. Finally, you need to run the React development server!

```bash
> npm start
```

### NOTE:

If you would like a production build of this project, once you have installed all of the required dependencies (step 2), you may run the following command instead of starting the React development server using `npm start`.

```bash
> npm build
```

That command shall create a folder in the root directory called `build` which will contain a compiled version of the project, ready to be hosted and used in the browser.

<sub>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).</sub>
